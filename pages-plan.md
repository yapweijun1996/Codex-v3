# Page Plan

This document outlines suggested content and improvements for each page in the admin panel.

## Dashboard (index.html)
- [x] Overview heading and short welcome message.
- [x] Data table of users with sorting and filtering tools.
- [x] Placeholder skeleton rows shown while data loads.
- [x] Loading logic removes the skeleton after data is fetched via a Promise.
- [x] Responsive grid layout using simple CSS grid.
- [x] Accessible color scheme with dark and light themes.
- [ ] Smooth sidebar animation using CSS transforms.
- [ ] Refine mobile sidebar so close button doesn't overlap items.
- [ ] Prevent zooming to keep layout stable on phones.

## Settings (settings.html)
- [x] Form fields for profile details with validation.
- [x] Toast notification when changes are saved.
- [x] Consistent spacing and margins across inputs.

## Reports (reports.html)
- [x] Chart.js graphs summarizing visitor data.
- [x] Options to switch between different report ranges.

## Future Pages
- **User Management** – dedicated page for adding or suspending users.
- **Analytics** – deeper insights with multiple charts and export options.
- **Profile** – personal account settings and password changes.

These plans build on the existing checklist and keep the overall dark theme while adding more robust features.
