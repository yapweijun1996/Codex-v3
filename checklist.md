- [x] Review sidebar behavior on small screens and ensure overlay closes properly
- [x] Add smooth transition when sidebar opens/closes and main content shifts
- [x] Expand responsive breakpoints for tablets and desktops
- [x] Persist sidebar open state so returning users keep their preference
- [x] Provide clear focus styles for all interactive elements

## Dark Mode Enhancements
- [x] Audit color contrast against accessibility guidelines
- [x] Use `prefers-color-scheme` to default to dark mode when possible
- [x] Add toggle switch to allow optional light theme

## General Panel Improvements
- [x] Mark active navigation links to orient the user
- [x] Consolidate header and navigation markup across pages for consistency
- [x] Add ARIA landmarks (nav, main, footer) for improved accessibility
- [x] Include basic icons next to sidebar items for visual clarity
