# Dark Admin Panel

This repository contains a minimal dark-mode admin panel prototype with PWA support.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. The service worker provides offline caching, and the layout adapts responsively from mobile to desktop.

## Header Component

The header markup is generated by `header.js` using `buildHeader(title, opts)`.
Include the script before your page content and call the function:

```html
<script src="header.min.js"></script>
<script>
  buildHeader('Admin Panel', { themeToggle: true });
</script>
```

The sidebar toggle appears on the right so it is reachable for right-handed mobile use. The header also includes a skip link for accessibility and optional theme toggle support.
