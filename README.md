# Dark Admin Panel

This repository contains a minimal dark-mode admin panel prototype with PWA support.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. The service worker provides offline caching, and the layout adapts responsively from mobile to desktop. Pages now use the ES module `main.min.js` and `style.min.css` built from the source files.

## Header Component

The header markup is generated by `header.js` using `buildHeader(title, opts)`.
Include the script before your page content and call the function:

```html
<script src="header.min.js"></script>
<script>
  buildHeader('Admin Panel', { themeToggle: true });
</script>
```

Include the footer script similarly and call `buildFooter()` to append a footer:

```html
<script src="footer.min.js"></script>
<script>buildFooter('v0.1');</script>
```

The sidebar toggle appears on the right so it is reachable for right-handed mobile use. The header also includes a skip link for accessibility and optional theme toggle support.
## Sidebar Component

The sidebar markup is created with `buildSidebar(active)`. Include `sidebar.min.js` and call the function with the page key so the navigation highlights the current page.

```html
<script src="sidebar.min.js"></script>
<script>buildSidebar("users");</script>
```


## Theming

Core colors are defined with CSS variables so both the dark and light themes stay consistent. The selected theme is stored in `localStorage` and applied early in the document head to prevent flashes of the wrong colors. Update `:root` variables in `style.css` to customize surface and border shades across the app.

### Profile Page

`profile.html` contains personal account controls. The form allows uploading a new avatar and changing the password. Submitting the form triggers a modal confirmation built with `openModal` in `main.min.js`.
The page now loads data from `api/profile.json` to show a profile card with your basic details.
