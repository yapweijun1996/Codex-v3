# Sidebar Improvement Checklist

This checklist focuses on refining how the sidebar functions and behaves across the admin pages.

- [x] Keep toggle button text and ARIA labels synced with the sidebar state.
- [x] Store open/close state in localStorage so the sidebar remembers its position.
- [x] Use CSS transforms for smooth slideâ€‘in animation on mobile and desktop.
- [x] Close the sidebar when pressing `Escape` or clicking the overlay.
- [x] Ensure links inside the sidebar close it after navigation.
- [x] Position the close button so it never overlaps menu items on small screens.
- [x] Consider focus management: move focus to the first link when opened and return focus to the toggle when closed.
- [x] Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by disabling transitions when appropriate.
